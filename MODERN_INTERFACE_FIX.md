# Modern Interface Navigation Fix

## Issue Description

In the modern task selection interface (`/modern`), when users clicked the "🚀 Run Task" button to execute a selected task, the interface would start the agent but immediately redirect back to the original select prompt page (`/`) instead of showing the agent execution interface.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the JavaScript code in `templates/select_prompt_modern.html`. Two functions were causing the problem:

1. **`runSelectedTask()`** - Used when running an existing task
2. **`submitNewTask()`** - Used when creating and running a new task

Both functions were making a POST request to `/run_agent` and then performing a redirect to `/` using `window.location.href = '/'`. This redirect was taking users back to the original select prompt page instead of allowing them to see the agent execution interface.

## Technical Details

### Original Problematic Code

```javascript
function runSelectedTask() {
    // ... task selection logic ...
    
    fetch('/run_agent', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (response.ok) {
            window.location.href = '/';  // ❌ This redirects to select prompt page
        } else {
            alert('Error running task');
        }
    })
    // ...
}
```

### The Fix

The fix involved changing the JavaScript to:
1. Capture the HTML response from the `/run_agent` endpoint
2. Replace the current page content with the agent execution interface
3. Avoid the redirect that was causing the navigation issue

```javascript
function runSelectedTask() {
    // ... task selection logic ...
    
    fetch('/run_agent', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (response.ok) {
            return response.text();  // ✅ Get the HTML response
        } else {
            throw new Error('Error running task');
        }
    })
    .then(html => {
        // ✅ Replace current page with agent execution interface
        document.open();
        document.write(html);
        document.close();
    })
    // ...
}
```

## Files Modified

- `templates/select_prompt_modern.html` - Fixed both `runSelectedTask()` and `submitNewTask()` functions

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User selects a task in the modern interface
2. User clicks "🚀 Run Task" 
3. The interface transitions directly to the agent execution view
4. User can see the agent working on their task in real-time
5. No unwanted redirect back to the task selection page

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to `/modern` 
2. Select any task
3. Click "🚀 Run Task"
4. Verify you are taken to the agent execution interface (not back to task selection)
5. Test creating a new task and running it to ensure that flow also works

The fix ensures a smooth user experience by maintaining the expected navigation flow in the modern interface.
