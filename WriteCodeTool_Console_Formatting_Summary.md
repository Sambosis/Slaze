# WriteCodeTool Console Formatting Implementation

## Overview
The WriteCodeTool has been modified to format its output like console input/output, similar to how the Bash, ProjectSetup, and EditTool display their operations. This provides a consistent user experience across all tools.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `_format_terminal_output` Method
A new method was added to format write code operations to look like terminal output:

```python
def _format_terminal_output(self, 
                           command: str, 
                           files: List[str] = None, 
                           result: str = None, 
                           error: str = None,
                           additional_info: str = None) -> str:
    """Format write code operations to look like terminal output."""
    output_lines = ["```console"]
    
    # Format the command with a pseudo-shell prompt
    if files:
        files_str = " ".join(files)
        output_lines.append(f"$ write_code {command} {files_str}")
    else:
        output_lines.append(f"$ write_code {command}")
    
    # Add the result/output if provided
    if result:
        output_lines.extend(result.rstrip().split('\n'))
    
    # Add error if provided
    if error:
        output_lines.append(f"Error: {error}")
    
    # Add additional info if provided
    if additional_info:
        output_lines.extend(additional_info.rstrip().split('\n'))
    
    # End console formatting
    output_lines.append("```")
    
    return "\n".join(output_lines)
```

### 2. Updated All Display Messages
All display messages throughout the WriteCodeTool now use console formatting:

#### Image Generation Detection
- **Before**: Plain text message about detected image files
- **After**: Console-style output showing image generation initiation

#### Individual Image Generation
- **Before**: Simple success message per image
- **After**: Console-style output showing each image generation

#### Code Generation Initiation
- **Before**: Plain text listing files to generate
- **After**: Console-style output showing code generation start

#### File Writing Success
- **Before**: Only formatted code display
- **After**: Console-style output showing file write success + formatted code

#### Process Completion
- **Before**: No display message for completion
- **After**: Console-style output showing final status and statistics

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Error messages now use console formatting:
- Configuration errors
- Critical errors
- Both display console-style error messages

## Example Output

### Image Generation Detection
```console
$ write_code generate_images logo.png banner.jpg
Detected image files, using PictureGenerationTool
Files to generate:
  - logo.png
  - banner.jpg
```

### Code Generation Initiation
```console
$ write_code generate_code main.py utils.py config.py
Starting code generation process
Files to generate:
  - main.py
  - utils.py
  - config.py
```

### File Writing Success
```console
$ write_code write_file main.py
File written successfully
Path: /workspace/main.py
Size: 1250 characters
Language: python
```

### Process Completion
```console
$ write_code write_codebase main.py utils.py config.py
Codebase generation completed successfully
Total files: 3
Successful: 3
Code files: 3/3
Image files: 0/0
Write path: /workspace
```

### Error Handling
```console
$ write_code write_codebase
Error: Configuration Error: REPO_DIR not set
```

## Key Features

### Multi-File Support
The console formatting elegantly handles multiple files by showing them in the command line:
- `$ write_code generate_code main.py utils.py config.py`

### Detailed Status Information
Each operation shows relevant details:
- File paths and sizes
- Language detection
- Success/failure counts
- Write paths

### Consistent Error Formatting
All errors follow the same console format for consistency.

### Preserved Functionality
The tool still displays formatted code using the existing `html_format_code` function, but now also shows console-style status messages.

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tools now use similar console-style formatting
2. **Clarity**: Operations clearly show what files are being processed
3. **Progress Tracking**: Users can see the progression through different phases
4. **Professional Appearance**: Terminal-like output looks polished and familiar
5. **Better Error Visibility**: Errors are clearly formatted and easy to spot

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All command types format correctly
- Multiple file handling works properly
- Error messages are properly formatted
- Console blocks are properly opened and closed
- File lists are correctly displayed
- Status information is comprehensive

The console formatting provides a professional and consistent way to display WriteCodeTool operations, making it clear to users what actions are being performed and their results across the entire codebase generation process.
