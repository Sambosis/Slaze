create a 3d simulation web app  of the airflow through a car. Use usig the simplest framework that can reasonably fulfill the requirements. 



The user should be able to customize the the size, angles and various other factors and be able to see how the air flow is effected. 



The simulation should show movement and be able to see the changes made live. 



you should see the air flow change based on the parameters.  make it very realistic and technical.  make sure that it works very good and looks good. when you are done, start simulation so I can see it work. 



When you start the simulation, make sure that you do it in a way that does not block the execution of the program.  You should be able to run the command to start the server, and then have the next line of code execute immediately.



If you are going to use any of your tools to help you do this, make sure that you explitly state that they should not block the execution of the program and that they are to open the wepage immediately after starting the server.
