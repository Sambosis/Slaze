The final goal is to create a novel 3d model that can be 3d printed that is a fidget toy.  
You should first create resuable parametric modules that can be used and reused to create the final model.
You could have things like gears, hinges, bearings, pins, bolts, springs, washers, nuts etc. that can be used to create the final model.
You must use python. 

It should have moving parts with some sort of hinges or bearings that have tight enough tolerances that they are able to function in a interesting way that could be used as a fidget toy.
