Create a strategy game that is based in Harford County Maryland. Use specific local references and have one team fight against another. Each team will actually be controlled by an LLM. They should not have internal knowledge about the others plans, knowledge etc.  I should be able to watch this play out as the game is played by each.  environment variables are saved for all major providers so you can choose what and how to structure the rest of the game.
