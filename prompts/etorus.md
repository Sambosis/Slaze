create some way for me to easily create stl's of a chain with varying parameters. The chain should a series of elongagted torus alternating at a 90 degree angle.  the second one should go through the hole in the first one.  I should be able to cusomize the size and thickness, the length of the chain, and if it fully connects to make a loop or if it is just a straight line of torus links.
make sure that you rotate every other link and have them interlock through the holes of the neighboring ones, position in the hole and not touching the outer surface of the torus.  The chain should be able to be exported as an stl file.
