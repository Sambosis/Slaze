Self-Learning Pinball: Prototype

Core Goal: Build a basic pinball game that learns to play itself. Include essential elements: flippers, bumpers, and a ball, then teach it to play using Stable Baselines3 for the AI. All game play should be displayed in real-time, with simple graphics and physics. Every training game should be shown live on the screen. 

Key Libraries:
• Pymunk for physics (ball movement, collisions)
• Pyglet for display (simple 2D graphics)
• Stable Baselines3 for the AI agent (handles all the RL complexity)
• Gymnasium for the environment structure
