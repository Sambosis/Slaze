Self-Learning Pinball: Prototype

Core Goal: Build a basic pinball game that learns to play itself. Include essential elements: flippers, bumpers, and a ball, then teach it to play using Stable Baselines3 for the AI. All game play should be displayed in real-time, with simple graphics and physics. Every training game should be shown live on the screen. The focus is on creating a functional prototype that demonstrates the learning process, not on complex game design.

Key Libraries:
• Pymunk for physics (ball movement, collisions)
• Pyglet for display (simple 2D graphics)
• Stable Baselines3 for the AI agent (handles all the RL complexity)
• Gymnasium for the environment structure
• Tensorboard for tracking progress
The Game Environment:
• Basic Layout:
Rectangular table with walls
Two flippers at the bottom
3-4 circular bumpers in the middle area
A drain at the bottom
Starting launcher (simple impulse)
• Physics (Pymunk):
Ball: Circle body with realistic bounce
Flippers: Segments with pivot joints
Bumpers: Static circles with high elasticity
Walls: Static segments
Keep the physics simple but satisfying
• Display (Pyglet): Simple shapes (circles, lines)
Basic colors to distinguish elements
Real-time visualization
No fancy graphics needed
• Game Logic:
Ball launches
Flippers respond to actions
Bumpers bounce ball with high elasticity
Points for bumper hits
Game over when ball drains
AI Setup (Stable Baselines3):
• State: Ball position/velocity, flipper positions
• Actions: Flip left/right (up/down)
• Rewards:
+1 for bumper hits
+0.1 for keeping ball in play
+2 when the flipper hits the ball
-10 when ball drains
• Use SB3's DQN with default settings initially
Basic Implementation Steps:
• Build the environment first (get the game working)
• Add the SB3 agent
• Train and watch it learn
• Adjust rewards/parameters until it worksSuccess Criteria:
• Ball bounces realistically
• Flippers work properly
• Bumpers provide good ball action
• Agent learns to keep the ball in play
Keep it simple, get it working, then iterate. The key is having a solid physics foundation with Pymunk and letting SB3 handle the learning part. Remember that every game needs to be displayed live on the screen.
