create a demo pygame game that is a simple 2d platformer game with a character that can jump and move left and right. 
The game should have a background, a character, and a platform. The character should be able to jump and move left and right.
When you are done, you need to make a executable file that you can run on your computer.
Much of the code is written, just use str_replace tool to edit it.
