Create a pygame algebra learning game with the following specifications:
It should not have a alot of features, just the basics.
The goal is just to get the game working.
Core Requirements:
Create a progressive difficulty system spanning 7th-12th grade algebra concepts
Implement a clean, minimalist interface with these components:
Problem display area
Input field for student answers
Hint button (limited uses per session)
Solution submission button
Detailed explanation panel (hidden until after attempt)
Technical Requirements:
Store problems and solutions in a structured JSON format
Include local storage for progress tracking
Problem Categories to Include:
ALL PROBLEMS MUST BE MULTIPLE CHOICE FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS
7th Grade Level:
Basic equations with one variable
Integer operations
Basic proportions
8th Grade Level:
Systems of equations
Introduction to functions
Graphing linear equations
9th-10th Grade Level:
Quadratic equations
Polynomial operations
Rational expressions
11th-12th Grade Level:
Logarithms
Complex numbers
Basic trigonometric equations
Features:
Each problem should include:
The algebraic problem
Multiple steps for solving
After each attempt:
Show step-by-step solution
Provide detailed explanation
Highlight key concepts
Include lots of problems. 
Progress System:
Track correct/incorrect answers
Adjust difficulty based on performance

Please provide the complete code implementation with:
Clear file structure
Commented code
Setup instructions
Small sample problem set for each grade level
Instructions for adding new problems
CSS styling
Basic Error handling
Basic Input validation
Progress tracking implementation
Local storage management

Each step should be focused making a working prototype. 

If you can identify a next step that would enable the flask app to run and a user to interact with it, then do that next.
