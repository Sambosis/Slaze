Create a Python application using Pygame and reinforcement learning that simulates and learns optimal bet sizing in blackjack. Here are the specific requirements:
1. Core Components:
- Implement a blackjack game engine using Pygame for visualization
- Create a reinforcement learning agent that focuses on bet sizing optimization
- Enforce basic strategy for all playing decisions (hit, stand, double, split)
- Track bankroll and maintain betting statistics
2. Game Logic Requirements:
- The agent must strictly follow basic strategy for all playing decisions
- Implement standard blackjack rules (dealer stands on soft 17, blackjack pays 3:2)
- Track the running count and true count for bet sizing decisions
- Maintain a betting spread based on the count and bankroll
- Show a full game playthrough every 50 games, :
- Update and display training statistics every 10 games, including:
- Include save/load functionality for the trained model
- Add configuration options for:
* Initial bankroll
* Betting limits
* Number of decks
* Training parameters
Please provide the complete implementation with appropriate comments and documentation.
