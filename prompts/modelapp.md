Your project directory has a log of work done on the following app.  It looks really good and runs. but it will not load the shapes on the display and it will not load or save model.  Do not start from scratch, just make the changes needed to make it work.   The buttons appear to do nothing, but I can change the values of the parameters in the UI.  
Analyse the code and make a plan to fix the issues. 
There may be extra files in your project directory, but start with app.py then figure out what is relevent from there. 


Make a 3d modelling web app that allows for parametric design. You should be able to click on a large list of primatives and 3d shapes, then fully customize them by changing their parameters.
