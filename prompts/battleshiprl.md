Train 2 RL Models to play the game battleship in pygame. They  should use different methods of learning.  Have them play each other in order to train. Each  should place their ships randomly each game.  Display training metrics and win / loss data to the console during training.  Every 5th match should be shown live to the screen using pygame so a user can watch the game play out.  There is no need to have the ability for a human to play  the model.
