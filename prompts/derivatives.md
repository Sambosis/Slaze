Create a training Jupyter Notebook that teaches a new student how to do integrals and derivatives.  Assume they do not know anything about calculus.  It should start easy and give detailed and interesting explanations.  It should be as interactive as possible and create lots of interesting plots and charts. It should use interesting real world examples. It should keep the attention of a student that has a hard time paying attention.
