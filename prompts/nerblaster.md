Technical Requirements for Advanced Nerf-Style Projectile Launcher Design & Simulation
Primary Objectives:

Design a high-performance projectile launcher optimized for:

Primary: projectile velocity (target: >300 m/s)
Secondary: Projectile accuracy

Technical Specifications Required:

Detailed mechanical design specifications
Propulsion system specifications
Projectile optimization parameters
Design all components, such as trigger, stop, and how you will generate the energy to launch the projectile, such as a spring or air pressure or other methods.
Make sure they are in your cad model.
Deliverables:

CAD models and engineering drawings
Material specifications
Assembly instructions

Performance Simulation
Python-based simulation framework incorporating:

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis
Projectile trajectory modeling
Performance optimization algorithms
Energy efficiency calculations

Technical Visualization

Generate programmatic technical drawings using Python libraries:

matplotlib for 2D visualizations
vtk/mayavi for 3D renderings
FEniCS for finite element analysis

└── research/           # Research findings and references
Additional Parameters:

All output files should be version controlled
Include comprehensive performance metrics
Document all assumptions and constraints

Get an expert opinion on technical details and performance optimizations. 

Some work has already been done so please examine the existing codebase and documentation before proceeding.
Create a virtual environment and use the uv package manager to install the necessary dependencies.
Your first step after reading current implementation details is to:
1. create your first cad model of a projectile launcher and save the nerf model to a file that can be viewed. 
2. ensure all directories that you write to actually exist.

2. try to use the tools created to simulate the projectile launcher
3. debug the tools.
4. improve the design of the nerf launcher


Your Job right now is to keep  creating cad models that would be capable of actually functioning in the real world.
