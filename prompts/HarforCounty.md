Create a 2d desktop strategy game using python that is based in Harford County Maryland. Use specific local references and landmarks. The player of the game should be trying to solve a mystery in each round. The mysteries should be dynamically created by an LLM. You will need to craft a prompt to ensure they come up with engaging storylines.  API Keys are in an .env file in the root of your project.  Feel free to use any of the ones in there, as well as any non LLM Keys in there  if they are helpful. It should be very visibly appealing, create images in advance, or download others from the web. The types of mysteries could be murders, government coverup, Strange happenings at Edgewood Arsenal or Aberdeen proving grounds, covered bridge, The Legend of Joppatowne's Sam Parker, Rumesey Mansion etc.
