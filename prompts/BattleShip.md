Train 2 RL Models to play the game battleship in pygame. They  should use different methods of learning.  Have them play each other in order to train. Each  should place their ships randomly each game. The top section of the pygame window should display the actual game boards and is where the games should play out live in 100 game intervals. The bottom section of the pygame window should display the training metrics as well as win / loss data comparing the 2 models.  Every 100th match should be shown live to the screen using pygame so a user can watch the game play out.  There is no need to have the ability for a human to play  the model.
