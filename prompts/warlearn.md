Create a reinforcement learning model for a Strategy Based War Game where 2 agents control their respective armies. The model should learn by playing itself. Use a high level helper framework for model training. Use Pydantic where possible. Be Mindeful of how you structure your imports. Use pygame to display full gameplay occasionally during training.
