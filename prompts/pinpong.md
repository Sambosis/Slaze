Create a pong style game where the paddles swing like pinball flippers. The flippers should move vertically on the screen like classic pong, however they should have the ability to swing towards the ball to control the angle and speed they return the ball.  Have 2 competing RL models train against each other.  use pygame to show every 5th game to the screen. do not use sound or create documentation.
