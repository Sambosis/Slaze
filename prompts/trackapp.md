I need a simple web app to view, add, update, change the data located in c:\repo\data.csv

The headers in the file are:
Priority, Salesperson, ID, NAME, Machine, Have Verbal Commit, Paperwork Date, Money Date, Installed Date, Status, Notes

The app should have the following features:
- A table to display the data from the CSV file
- A way to add new data to the CSV file
- A way to update existing data in the CSV file
- A way to delete data from the CSV file
- A way to filter the data in the table
- A way to sort the data in the table
