# EditTool Console Formatting Implementation

## Overview
The EditTool has been modified to format its output like console input/output, similar to how the Bash and ProjectSetup tools display their operations. This provides a consistent user experience across all tools.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `_format_terminal_output` Method
A new method was added to format edit operations to look like terminal output:

```python
def _format_terminal_output(self, 
                           command: str, 
                           path: str, 
                           result: str = None, 
                           error: str = None,
                           additional_info: str = None) -> str:
    """Format edit operations to look like terminal output."""
    output_lines = ["```console"]
    
    # Format the command with a pseudo-shell prompt
    output_lines.append(f"$ edit {command} {path}")
    
    # Add the result/output if provided
    if result:
        output_lines.extend(result.rstrip().split('\n'))
    
    # Add error if provided
    if error:
        output_lines.append(f"Error: {error}")
    
    # Add additional info if provided
    if additional_info:
        output_lines.extend(additional_info.rstrip().split('\n'))
    
    # End console formatting
    output_lines.append("```")
    
    return "\n".join(output_lines)
```

### 2. Updated All Command Display Messages
All commands now use the new console formatting:

#### Create Command
- **Before**: Plain text messages
- **After**: Console-style output showing file creation with preview

#### View Command
- **Before**: Simple success message
- **After**: Console-style output showing file viewing with content preview

#### String Replace Command
- **Before**: Multiple separate messages for old/new text
- **After**: Console-style output showing replacement details

#### Insert Command
- **Before**: Simple success message
- **After**: Console-style output showing insertion details

#### Undo Edit Command
- **Before**: Simple success message
- **After**: Console-style output showing undo operation

### 3. Updated Error Handling
Error messages now also use console formatting to maintain consistency.

### 4. Removed Unused Code
- Removed the unused `format_output` method
- Removed the initial "Executing Command" message since operations now show console-style output

## Example Output

### Create Command
```console
$ edit create /path/to/file.txt
File created successfully
Content length: 150 characters
Preview (first 200 chars):
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### View Command
```console
$ edit view /path/to/file.txt
File viewed successfully
     1	def hello_world():
     2	    print("Hello, World!")
```

### String Replace Command
```console
$ edit str_replace /path/to/file.txt
Text replacement completed successfully
Old text: Hello, World!
New text: Hello, Universe!
```

### Error Example
```console
$ edit create /path/to/file.txt
Error: File already exists
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tools now use similar console-style formatting
2. **Clarity**: Operations look like actual terminal commands
3. **Better UX**: Users can easily understand what operations were performed
4. **Familiarity**: Follows the same pattern as Bash and ProjectSetup tools

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All command types format correctly
- Error messages are properly formatted
- Console blocks are properly opened and closed
- Content previews are appropriately truncated
- Multi-line content is handled correctly

The console formatting provides a consistent and intuitive way to display EditTool operations, making it clear to users what actions were performed and their results.
