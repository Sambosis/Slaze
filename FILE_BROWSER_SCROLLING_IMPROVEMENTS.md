# File Browser Scrolling Improvements

## Overview
The file browser viewer has been enhanced to ensure proper scrolling functionality for large files while maintaining the visibility of the console panel and secondary toolbar with user messages.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Flex Container Scrolling**
- **Problem**: The editor content area was not properly constrained within the CSS Grid layout, causing large files to push the console panel and sidebar off-screen.
- **Solution**: Added `height: 0` and `min-height: 0` to flex items to force them to respect container bounds:
  ```css
  .editor-content {
      height: 0; /* Force flex item to respect container bounds */
      min-height: 0; /* Allow flex item to shrink below content size */
  }
  ```

### 2. **Enhanced Console and Sidebar Scrolling**
- Applied the same flex container fixes to:
  - `.console-content` - Console panel scrolling
  - `.user-messages` - User messages panel scrolling  
  - `.sidebar` - File explorer scrolling

### 3. **Improved Code Display**
- Enhanced pre and code elements for better scrolling:
  ```css
  .editor-content pre {
      word-wrap: normal; /* Prevent unwanted line wrapping */
  }
  
  .editor-content code {
      display: block; /* Ensure code takes full width for proper scrolling */
  }
  ```

### 4. **Better Scrollbar Styling**
- Increased scrollbar size from 8px to 12px for better visibility
- Added border radius and improved styling
- Added Firefox scrollbar support with `scrollbar-width` and `scrollbar-color`
- Applied consistent scrollbar styling across all scrollable areas

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Loading Indicator**: Added a spinning loader when opening files
- **Large File Warning**: Warns users before loading files larger than 1MB
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and loading states

## Layout Structure
The file browser uses a CSS Grid layout that maintains fixed areas:

```css
.vscode-container {
    grid-template-areas: 
        "titlebar titlebar titlebar"
        "sidebar editor right-sidebar"
        "sidebar console right-sidebar";
    grid-template-rows: 35px 1fr 200px;
}
```

This ensures:
- **Titlebar**: Always visible at the top (35px)
- **Main Area**: Flexible height for content (1fr)
- **Console Panel**: Fixed height at bottom (200px)
- **Sidebars**: Full height spanning main area and console

## Benefits

### ✅ **Proper Scrolling**
- Large files now scroll vertically within the editor area
- Wide files scroll horizontally without affecting layout
- Console and user messages panels remain visible at all times

### ✅ **Consistent Layout**
- Console panel stays fixed at the bottom
- User messages sidebar remains visible on the right
- File explorer maintains its position on the left

### ✅ **Performance**
- Large file warning prevents browser slowdown
- Loading indicators provide user feedback
- Smooth scrolling experience across all panels

## Testing
The improvements were tested with:
- Files with 150+ lines (vertical scrolling)
- Files with very long lines (horizontal scrolling)
- Large files (1MB+ warning system)
- Multiple open tabs
- Responsive behavior

## Browser Compatibility
The scrolling improvements work across modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium (WebKit scrollbars)
- Firefox (scrollbar-width/scrollbar-color)
- Safari (WebKit scrollbars)
- Edge (WebKit scrollbars)

## Files Modified
- `templates/file_browser.html` - Main file browser template with all scrolling improvements

The file browser now provides a robust, VS Code-like experience with proper scrolling behavior that maintains the visibility of all interface elements.
