# Message Display Fix Documentation

## Problem
The application had an issue where console-style messages and user messages were not displaying when running locally, although they worked correctly on Heroku.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Different Server Configurations**: Heroku uses Gunicorn with eventlet worker which properly handles WebSocket connections, while the local development server was using Flask's built-in server with different threading behavior.

2. **WebSocket Timing Issues**: Messages were being added to the display before the WebSocket client was fully connected and ready to receive them.

3. **Missing Error Handling**: The WebSocket emit operations didn't have proper error handling, causing silent failures when clients weren't connected.

4. **Missing Method**: The code referenced a non-existent `_emit_file_tree_update` method which could cause errors.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in WebUI
- Added try-except blocks around all `socketio.emit()` calls to handle connection failures gracefully
- Added detailed logging to track message flow and identify issues
- Messages are always stored in arrays regardless of WebSocket state, ensuring they can be retrieved via the `/messages` endpoint

### 2. Fixed WebSocket Connection Synchronization
- Modified the `connect` event handler to always send all existing messages when a client connects
- This ensures that even if messages were added before the client connected, they will be received

### 3. Created Eventlet-Based Local Runner
- Created `run_local.py` which uses eventlet (same as production) for proper WebSocket support
- This ensures the local environment behaves similarly to the Heroku deployment

### 4. Fixed Code Issues
- Commented out the call to the non-existent `_emit_file_tree_update` method
- Added proper error handling for broadcast operations

## How to Use

### For Local Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the new eventlet-based runner for better WebSocket support
python run_local.py --port 5002

# Or with manual tool confirmation
python run_local.py --port 5002 --manual-tools

# To prevent browser from opening automatically
python run_local.py --port 5002 --no-browser
```

### Original Method (Still Available)
```bash
# Original CLI interface
python run.py web --port 5002
```

## Key Changes Made

### `/workspace/utils/web_ui.py`
1. Added error handling to `add_message()` method
2. Added error handling to `broadcast_update()` method  
3. Enhanced `connect` event handler to always send existing messages
4. Fixed reference to non-existent method
5. Added detailed logging throughout

### `/workspace/run_local.py` (New File)
- Created a new runner that uses eventlet's WSGI server
- Ensures proper WebSocket support in local development
- Matches production environment behavior

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start the server using `python run_local.py`
2. Open the browser and select/create a task
3. Verify that:
   - User messages appear in the left pane
   - Console messages appear in the main pane
   - Tool execution results are displayed
   - Messages persist across page refreshes

## Technical Details

### Message Flow
1. Agent calls `display.add_message(type, content)`
2. Message is stored in the appropriate array (`user_messages`, `assistant_messages`, or `tool_results`)
3. Message is emitted via WebSocket to all connected clients
4. If WebSocket fails, message is still stored and can be retrieved via `/messages` endpoint
5. When a new client connects, all existing messages are sent immediately

### WebSocket Events
- `connect`: Sends all existing messages to newly connected client
- `update`: Broadcasts message updates to all clients
- `user_message`, `assistant_message`, `tool_result`: Specific message type events

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
1. Message persistence in a database for better reliability
2. Message queue system for guaranteed delivery
3. Reconnection logic with message synchronization
4. Rate limiting for message broadcasts
5. Compression for large message payloads
