# Expanded Task Description

I'll create a simple 2D platformer game using Pygame. The game will feature:

1. A player character that can:
   - Move left and right with arrow keys
   - Jump with the space bar
   - Be affected by gravity (fall when not on a platform)

2. Multiple platforms for the player to stand on and navigate

3. A static background image

4. Basic collision detection to ensure the player can stand on platforms

5. Simple game states (running, game over if player falls off-screen)

The game will use object-oriented programming with classes for the player and platforms. I'll implement basic physics for movement and jumping, and include a simple game loop that handles events, updates game state, and renders everything to the screen.

For distribution, I'll ensure the game can be packaged as an executable file using PyInstaller, allowing it to run on various operating systems without requiring a Python installation.

```Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/execgame. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
