# Expanded Description: Reinforcement Learning Model for a Strategy Based War Game

The task is to create a reinforcement learning model that learns to play a turn-based strategy war game by playing against itself. The war game will involve two agents, each controlling an army on a grid-based map, with the objective of defeating the enemy army. 

To make this more concrete, I'll define the following game mechanics:

1. **Game Environment**: 
   - A 2D grid map (15x15) with various terrain types (plains, forests, hills, water) that affect movement and combat.
   - Each cell can contain units from only one player at a time.

2. **Units and Resources**:
   - Each army starts with a base and a set number of resource points.
   - Players can spend resources to create different unit types (infantry, cavalry, archers).
   - Units have different attributes: health, attack power, range, movement points.

3. **Game Flow**:
   - Turn-based gameplay where each player takes all their actions before passing to the opponent.
   - Actions include: creating units, moving units, attacking enemy units.
   - Game ends when one player's base is destroyed or after a set number of turns (200 turns).

4. **Learning Approach**:
   - Will implement a novel "Hierarchical Policy Gradient" approach, where the agent learns at two levels:
     - Strategic level: resource allocation and unit production decisions
     - Tactical level: movement and combat decisions for individual units
   - The hierarchical approach allows the agent to learn more efficiently by structuring the problem.
   - Will use self-play with policy gradients and experience replay to improve learning.

5. **Visualization**:
   - A simple 2D visualization using Pygame that shows the state of the game board.
   - Different colors will represent different units, terrain, and players.
   - Every 50 training iterations, a full game will be visualized to show learning progress.

6. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Will ensure compatibility with both CPU and GPU through PyTorch's device-agnostic code.
   - A save/load system for the trained models.
   - An option to exit the visualization or training at any point.

This structure aims for simplicity while maintaining clear separation of concerns between different parts of the system.Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/warlearn. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
