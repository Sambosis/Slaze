# Expanded Description: GUI Abacus Web App

This project involves creating a web-based abacus calculator that performs calculations in real-time. The abacus will have a graphical interface that mimics a traditional abacus with beads that can be moved up and down. As users interact with the abacus, calculations will be displayed immediately.

For the web platform, we'll use React.js for the frontend due to its efficiency in handling real-time state changes and rendering. For the backend, we'll use Express.js (Node.js) as a lightweight server to serve the React application. This combination provides a modern, responsive web application that can be easily deployed and maintained.

The abacus will support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and will include multiple rows to represent different place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). The user interface will be intuitive, allowing users to drag beads up and down or click them to change their positions. The current calculation result will be displayed prominently on the screen.

To handle the installation and initialization of the project, we'll create Python scripts that automate the setup process, including installing Node.js, npm packages, and initializing the project. We'll also create a script to start the server in a non-blocking way using Python's subprocess module to track the process ID for later use.

Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/abacus. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
