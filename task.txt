# Expanded Description: Pygame Maze Navigation App

This project involves creating a visually appealing maze application using Pygame. The application will dynamically generate a new random maze each time it runs or when the previous maze is solved. The key features include:

1. **Dynamic Maze Generation**: A new maze will be generated using a randomized algorithm (such as depth-first search with backtracking) each time the application starts or after a maze is solved.

2. **Automated Navigation**: Instead of player input, the application will include an AI agent (using an algorithm like A* or wall-following) that automatically navigates the character through the maze.

3. **Visual Design**: The maze will have appealing graphics with distinct colors for walls, paths, the character, and the goal. Basic animations will be included for the character's movement.

4. **Restart Functionality**: When the AI agent successfully reaches the goal, a new maze will be automatically generated, and the process will start over.

5. **User Interaction**: The only user input will be the ability to press the ESC key to quit the application. No other user inputs will be processed.

6. **Window Configuration**: The application will run in a fixed-size window with appropriate dimensions for maze visibility.

   - These files are not imported directly but loaded at runtime.Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/maze. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
