# Expanded Description

I'll create a basic "Hello World" GUI application in Python. The application will display a simple window with the text "Hello, World!" on it. I'll use Tkinter, which is a standard GUI toolkit that comes bundled with Python, making it accessible without additional installations. The application will consist of a single window with the greeting message centrally displayed.

# File Tree

1. **main.py**
   - Purpose: The main entry point of the application that creates and displays a window with "Hello, World!" text
   - Import: This is the top-level file, so no imports of other project files are needed

This simple project only requires a single file since it's a basic hello world GUI application. No additional assets or code files are necessary.Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/heyworld. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
