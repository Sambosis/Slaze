# Maze Navigation App in Pygame

## Expanded Description

I'll create a maze generation and navigation application using Pygame. The app will dynamically generate a new maze each time the computer-controlled character successfully navigates from start to finish. The maze will be visually appealing with clear graphics and smooth animations.

For the maze generation, I'll implement a depth-first search algorithm with recursive backtracking, which creates perfect mazes (mazes with exactly one path between any two points). The maze will be represented as a grid of cells with walls between them.

The computer-controlled character will navigate through the maze using the A* pathfinding algorithm, which is efficient for finding the shortest path in a maze. Once the character reaches the end of the maze, a new maze will be automatically generated with different dimensions to add variety.

Visual aspects will include:
- Smooth animations for the character movement
- Distinct colors for walls, paths, start, and end points
- Visual feedback when a maze is completed
- A simple transition effect between mazes

The user can quit the application by pressing the ESC key, and there will be no other user inputs required.

1. **maze_app.py**
   - Purpose: Main entry point for the application, initializes Pygame, handles the game loop and events
   - Import: Not imported by other files

2. **maze_generator.py**
   - Purpose: Contains algorithms for generating random mazes using depth-first search with recursive backtracking
   - Import: `from maze_generator import MazeGenerator`

3. **pathfinder.py**
   - Purpose: Implements the A* pathfinding algorithm for the computer-controlled character
   - Import: `from pathfinder import AStarPathfinder`

4. **renderer.py**
   - Purpose: Handles all visual aspects including drawing the maze, character, and transition effects
   - Import: `from renderer import MazeRenderer`

5. **character.py**
   - Purpose: Defines the computer-controlled character, its properties, and movement logic
   - Import: `from character import Character`

6. **assets/sprites/**
   - Purpose: Directory to store character and maze element sprites
   - Contains:
     - **character.png** - sprite for the navigating character
     - **wall.png** - texture for maze walls
     - **floor.png** - texture for walkable paths
     - **start.png** - marker for the maze entrance
     - **end.png** - marker for the maze exit

7. **constants.py**
   - Purpose: Contains game constants, colors, configuration settings
   - Import: `from constants import *`

8. **utils.py**
   - Purpose: Utility functions for calculations, conversions, and helper methods
   - Import: `from utils import *`Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/maze. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
