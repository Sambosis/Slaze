At the bottom is a detailed description of code that you need to write, followed by a code skeleton that provides the structure.
                    
        Active Task: # Expanded Description

I'll create a basic "Hello World" GUI application in Python. The application will display a simple window with the text "Hello, World!" on it. I'll use Tkinter, which is a standard GUI toolkit that comes bundled with Python, making it accessible without additional installations. The application will consist of a single window with the greeting message centrally displayed.

# File Tree

1. **main.py**
   - Purpose: The main entry point of the application that creates and displays a window with "Hello, World!" text
   - Import: This is the top-level file, so no imports of other project files are needed

This simple project only requires a single file since it's a basic hello world GUI application. No additional assets or code files are necessary.Start testing as soon as possible. DO NOT start making fixes or improvements until you have tested to see if it is working as is.  Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/heyworld. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.


        Your task is to implement the full code based on the description and skeleton. Make sure you provide your response in the requested programming language. Your response should include the code for the entire file including proper import lines, but do not actually include the code from other files.

        You should print verbose output to the console to show the progress of the code execution. This will help the user understand what is happening at each step of the process.
                    
        If you are requested to make changes to an existing file, please provide the full file with the correction made as your response. Please keep your changes limited to what was requested and keep the rest of the code unchanged.
                    
        If you see possible errors that are outside of the scope of the request, please make a note of them using inline comments in the code. Provide additional explanation as needed in comments.
                    
        If you see additional improvements that could be made to the code, please make a note of them at the bottom of the code in the comments, but do not make the changes.
                    
        You may be occasionally asked to provide non-typical file responses, such as Markdown, Readme, ipynb, txt, etc. Please provide the file in the requested format instead of providing code that would generate the file.

        All of the code that you provide needs to be enclosed in a single markdown style code block with the language specified.
        Here is an example of what your response should look like:
        ```python
        # Your code goes here
        ```
        If it was javascript it would look like this:
        ```javascript
        // Your code goes here
        ```

# Check if the script is being run directly
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Script is being run directly.")
    main()
else:
    print("Script is being imported, not run directly.")

# Possible Improvements (Not Implemented):
# 1. More sophisticated layout management using `grid()` or `place()`.
# 2. Adding more widgets (buttons, entry fields, etc.).
# 3. Implementing graceful shutdown procedures.
# 4. Adding unit tests.
# 5. Separating the GUI class (`HelloWorldApp`) into its own file (e.g., `hello_world_gui.py`)
#    as originally hinted in the description, and importing it here. This improves modularity
#    for larger applications.
# 6. Adding more robust error logging.
```

                    
        Here is the description of the code:
        Create a main.py file that serves as the main entry point for the Hello World GUI application, importing from the existing hello_world_gui.py file that already exists in the project directory. The file should:

1. Import the necessary modules: tkinter and sys for error handling
2. Import the HelloWorldApp class from the existing hello_world_gui module
3. Define a main function that:
   - Creates a Tkinter root window instance
   - Initializes the HelloWorldApp with the root window
   - Starts the Tkinter main event loop
4. Include a conditional check to ensure the main function is only called when the script is run directly

The code should be clean, concise, and include appropriate error handling.
                    
        Here is the code skeleton to implement:
