        Active Task: # Expanded Description: GUI Abacus Web App

This project involves creating a web-based abacus calculator that performs calculations in real-time. The abacus will have a graphical interface that mimics a traditional abacus with beads that can be moved up and down. As users interact with the abacus, calculations will be displayed immediately.

For the web platform, we'll use React.js for the frontend due to its efficiency in handling real-time state changes and rendering. For the backend, we'll use Express.js (Node.js) as a lightweight server to serve the React application. This combination provides a modern, responsive web application that can be easily deployed and maintained.

The abacus will support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and will include multiple rows to represent different place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). The user interface will be intuitive, allowing users to drag beads up and down or click them to change their positions. The current calculation result will be displayed prominently on the screen.

To handle the installation and initialization of the project, we'll create Python scripts that automate the setup process, including installing Node.js, npm packages, and initializing the project. We'll also create a script to start the server in a non-blocking way using Python's subprocess module to track the process ID for later use.

Your project directory is /home/myuser/apps/abacus. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.


        Your task is to implement the full code based on the description and skeleton. Make sure you provide your response in the requested programming language. Your response should include the code for the entire file including proper import lines, but do not actually include the code from other files.

        You should print verbose output to the console to show the progress of the code execution. This will help the user understand what is happening at each step of the process.
                    
        If you are requested to make changes to an existing file, please provide the full file with the correction made as your response. Please keep your changes limited to what was requested and keep the rest of the code unchanged.
                    
        If you see possible errors that are outside of the scope of the request, please make a note of them using inline comments in the code. Provide additional explanation as needed in comments.
                    
        If you see additional improvements that could be made to the code, please make a note of them at the bottom of the code in the comments, but do not make the changes.
                    
        You may be occasionally asked to provide non-typical file responses, such as Markdown, Readme, ipynb, txt, etc. Please provide the file in the requested format instead of providing code that would generate the file.

        All of the code that you provide needs to be enclosed in a single markdown style code block with the language specified.
        Here is an example of what your response should look like:
        ```python
        # Your code goes here
        ```
        If it was javascript it would look like this:
        ```javascript
        // Your code goes here
        ```

// - Implement more specific CORS origins for production environments instead of allowing all (*).
// - Add request logging middleware (like morgan) for better request tracking.
// - Implement more robust error handling and reporting.
// - Add security headers using middleware like `helmet`.
// - If the application requires more complex backend logic, consider structuring API routes in separate files/modules.

  // According to the configuration (specifically rollupOptions.input below),
  // index.html is expected inside the 'src' directory.
  // If index.html is intended to be in the 'web_app' root (alongside vite.config.js),

// Possible Improvement: Add environment variable handling (e.g., using `loadEnv`) for different configurations (development vs. production).
// Possible Improvement: Implement code splitting for better performance if the application grows large.
// Note: The `root` configuration and `rollupOptions.input` imply that `index.html` must reside within the `src` directory. This might require adjusting the project structure or this configuration file based on where `index.html` is actually located (`public/index.html` vs `src/index.html`). The Express server (`server.js`) is currently configured to serve static files from `dist` and expects `index.html` within `dist` after the build. This Vite config should produce that structure.

        Here is the description of the code:
        Implement the build.py file with the three functions outlined in the skeleton:
1. check_command_exists - To check if a command like node or npm is available
2. run_command - To run a command with proper error handling
3. build_frontend - To build the React frontend application

The implementation will:
- Use subprocess for running commands
- Check for Node.js and npm
- Install dependencies and build the React app
- Provide proper error reporting
